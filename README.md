# Customer Churn Analysis
This project analyzes customer churn and identifies key factors contributing to customer departure. The objective is to understand patterns behind churn and build a model to predict which customers are likely to leave.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major issue for businesses, especially in subscription-based models. Identifying the reasons behind churn and predicting which customers are likely to leave helps businesses take preventive actions and improve customer retention.

## Solution
## This project aims to:

- Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Predict which customers are likely to leave using machine learning models.
- Provide insights to help businesses reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset or similar datasets, which contains information such as:

- **Customer demographics:** Age, gender, location.
- **Account information:** Contract type, tenure, payment method.
- **Usage patterns:** Monthly charges, total charges, services used.
  
## Steps
- **Data Collection:** Load and examine the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and prepare data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualize data to find patterns related to churn.
- **Modeling:** Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).
- **Evaluation:** Measure model performance and accuracy.
- **Insights:** Provide actionable insights based on the analysis.
- **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:**
Pandas
Matplotlib/Seaborn,
Scikit-Learn

## Results
The model successfully predicts which customers are likely to churn with a prediction accuracy ____

## Future Work
Explore additional models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
Develop a dashboard for real-time churn prediction.
